      <h2>Advanced Research Projects</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Dynamic Hybrid Machine Learning Forecasting Mechanism for Time-Series Data</strong><br>
          Designed a novel hybrid model that dynamically adjusts the contribution of individual learning models to improve prediction accuracy over large-scale, time-dependent datasets.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Reinforcement Learning and Lyapunov-Based Controller for Microgrid Stability</strong><br>
          Developed a control strategy combining Lyapunov stability theory with reinforcement learning to ensure adaptive stability in fluctuating microgrid environments.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Adaptive Model Predictive Control (MPC) for Industrial Load Shedding</strong><br>
          Implemented a data-driven MPC approach that enables optimal and responsive load shedding in industrial sectors based on real-time conditions.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Adaptive Hybrid Controller for Modular Multilevel Converter in Solid-State Transformer Applications</strong><br>
          Proposed an adaptive hybrid control technique for precise and robust operation of MMCs in advanced solid-state transformer architectures.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Adaptive and Intelligent Power System Architecture</strong><br>
          Proposed a new swarm-based adaptive architecture for future power systems that integrates decentralized intelligence and real-time clustering.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>AI Guardian: Preventing Cascading Failures in Power Grids</strong><br>
          Introduced the concept of an “AI Guardian” to detect instability patterns and apply control actions in advance to prevent blackouts and cascading failures.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Adaptive Heun-Based Controller for MMC Converters</strong><br>
          Developed a numerically stable and efficient adaptive controller based on Heun's method for control of modular multilevel converters.
