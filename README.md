      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I have a strong interest in Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning, Control Systems, Robotics, Optimization Techniques, Smart Cities (IoT), Smart grids, and Electrical Vehicles.I aim to become a highly qualified independent researcher with specialized technical, innovative, and necessary leadership skills. Furthermore, our world requires leadership within the scientific community because complex problems can be solved effectively using a combination of technical engineering research and a renewed focus on policy issues. I hope to be at the forefront of solving some of these issues upon completing my Ph.D.
